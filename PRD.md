## 1. Summary

CoopLumen is an open-source, decentralized community finance network built on the Stellar blockchain. It allows any group — a cooperative, NGO, diaspora network, or local savings circle — to issue its own community token, manage a shared treasury, offer peer-to-peer micro-loans, and govern collectively through on-chain proposals.

**Mission:** Make decentralized community finance accessible to any group, anywhere, with no prior crypto expertise required.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Financial Exclusion at Scale

- 1.4 billion adults globally remain unbanked (World Bank, 2022)
- Community savings groups (ROSCAs, SACCOs, tontines) manage billions informally with no audit trail, no fraud protection, and no interoperability
- NGOs and cooperatives rely on wire transfers with 3–7% fees and 3–5 day settlement times
- Existing DeFi solutions (Ethereum, Solana) are too expensive, too technically complex, or too volatile for everyday community use

### Specific Pain Points

| Group                 | Problem                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Local savings circles | No digital record; fraud risk; limited reach          |
| Diaspora communities  | High remittance fees to send money home               |
| NGOs                  | Grant disbursement is slow, opaque, and auditor-heavy |
| Co-ops                | No shared ledger; governance is manual and slow       |

---

## 3. Solution Overview

CoopLumen leverages Stellar's strengths — near-zero fees, 3–5 second finality, built-in asset primitives — to give any community a sovereign financial layer:

1. **Community tokens** — Any group issues its own asset (e.g., `ECOLGS` for Eco Lagos), redeemable within the community
2. **Shared treasury** — Multi-sig distributor accounts hold and disburse community funds transparently
3. **P2P micro-lending** — Members can offer and request loans settled in community tokens or XLM, with on-chain repayment tracking
4. **On-chain governance** — (Phase 3) Soroban smart contracts power proposal voting weighted by token holding and reputation
5. **Simple UX** — Next.js dashboard + Freighter wallet; no private key management by users

## 5. Core Features

### 5.1 On-Chain Asset Issuance

- Community admin generates or imports a Stellar keypair for the issuer account
- System creates a custom asset (`<CODE>/<ISSUER>`) on Stellar Testnet or Mainnet
- Initial supply is sent to a community distributor account (multi-sig in Phase 2)
- Asset metadata stored in PostgreSQL for fast querying
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] Asset appears on Stellar Explorer after issuance
  - [ ] Distributor account balance reflects initial supply
  - [ ] Community record created in DB with correct `asset_code` and `asset_issuer`

### 5.2 Trustline Management

- Members must establish a trustline before receiving community tokens
- Backend provides a signed trustline transaction, or builds unsigned XDR for Freighter signing
- Trustline limit is configurable per community policy
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] Member account can receive and hold community token after trustline
  - [ ] `hasTrustline()` correctly returns `true`/`false`

### 5.3 Community Wallet Management

- Dashboard shows all balances for connected Freighter wallet
- Members can view community token balance alongside XLM
- Balance refreshes every 15 seconds via SWR
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] Freighter connection persists across page refreshes (via local state)
  - [ ] Balances load within 2 seconds on testnet

### 5.4 Peer-to-Peer Lending _(Phase 2)_

- Member submits loan request (amount, asset, due date)
- Another member accepts and funds the loan; on-chain payment is recorded
- Repayment tracked both on-chain and in PostgreSQL
- Reputation score updated on repayment or default
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] Loan flow completes end-to-end on testnet
  - [ ] Default status updates automatically when `due_at` passes without repayment

### 5.5 Governance & Reputation _(Phase 3)_

- Token-weighted proposals via Soroban smart contracts
- Proposal types: treasury disbursement, member admission, rule change
- Reputation score (integer) stored off-chain, influenced by: repayment history, tenure, participation
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] Proposal created and vote tallied correctly on-chain
  - [ ] Reputation scores visible in member profiles

### 5.6 Identity & KYC Integration _(Phase 4)_

- SEP-12 KYC integration with anchor providers
- Optional World ID / Proof of Humanity gate for governance
- On-chain attestation for verified communities

## 6. Architecture Overview

### Stack

| Layer      | Technology                            | Rationale                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Frontend   | Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript   | SSR/SSG, strong typing, ecosystem   |
| Wallet     | Freighter browser extension           | Stellar-native, widely used         |
| Backend    | Node.js 20, Express 4, TypeScript     | Familiar ecosystem, strong typing   |
| Blockchain | Stellar SDK, Horizon REST API         | Near-zero fees, fast finality       |
| Database   | PostgreSQL 16                         | Off-chain metadata, complex queries |
| Containers | Docker, Docker Compose                | Reproducible dev environment        |
| Testing    | Jest, ts-jest, @testing-library/react | Unit and integration coverage       |

### Data Flow

```
User action (e.g., Request loan)
  └─► Freighter signs XDR transaction (client-side)
        └─► Backend validates & submits to Horizon
              └─► Stellar Network settles (~4s)
                    └─► Backend records metadata to PostgreSQL
                          └─► Frontend re-fetches via SWR
```

### Security Principles

- No private keys ever stored server-side for user wallets
- Community distributor keys stored encrypted (Phase 2: multi-sig threshold)
- All user-facing mutations require signed Stellar transactions — no privileged backend bypass
- API inputs validated with `express-validator` before processing
- Helmet.js CSP and CORS headers enforced

## 7. User Stories

### Community Setup

```
As a community treasurer,
I want to register my community and issue a custom token,
so that members have a shared digital currency to transact with.

Acceptance criteria:
- Community name and asset code are unique
- Token appears on testnet after issuance API call
- Treasurer receives confirmation with transaction hash
```

```
As a community member,
I want to connect my Freighter wallet and establish a trustline,
so that I can receive community tokens.

Acceptance criteria:
- Freighter connect button opens wallet popup
- Trustline transaction built and signed by wallet
- Balance panel shows 0 TOKENCODE after trustline
```

### Treasury Operations

```
As a community treasurer,
I want to disburse tokens to multiple members at once,
so that grant funds reach beneficiaries efficiently.

Acceptance criteria:
- Batch payment operation sends to up to 100 members per transaction
- Each member balance updates on dashboard within 15s
```

### Lending (Phase 2)

```
As a community member,
I want to apply for a micro-loan in my community's token,
so that I can cover short-term expenses without leaving my community.

Acceptance criteria:
- Loan application requires: amount, purpose, repayment date
- Loan status is visible to lender and borrower
- Repayment triggers on-chain transfer and status update to "repaid"
```

### Governance (Phase 3)

```
As a token holder,
I want to vote on treasury proposals,
so that the community governs its funds democratically.

Acceptance criteria:
- Voting weight = token balance at proposal creation snapshot
- Proposal passes when quorum (>50% of supply) votes "yes"
- Result recorded on-chain via Soroban contract
```
