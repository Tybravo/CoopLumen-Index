## 1. Code of Conduct

All participants are expected to uphold our community standards:

- **Be respectful.** Critique code, not people.
- **Be inclusive.** Welcome contributors of all backgrounds and skill levels.
- **Be patient.** Maintainers are volunteers; allow 72 hours for responses.
- **Be constructive.** Explain _why_, not just _what_ when requesting changes.

Violations may be reported to `conduct@cooplumen.org`. Serious violations result in temporary or permanent ban.

```

New contributors: start with issues labeled [`good first issue`](#issue-labeling-scheme). `backend/src/contracts/` and `backend/src/api/routes/` are the best places to add features once you understand the flow.

## 4. Development Workflow

```
main  ──────────────────────────────────────────► (protected, always deployable)
         │
         ├── feature/token-batch-disburse  ──► PR ──► review ──► squash merge
         ├── fix/trustline-race-condition   ──► PR ──► review ──► squash merge
         └── docs/update-api-reference      ──► PR ──► review ──► squash merge
```

1. **Sync your fork** before starting any work:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```
2. **Create a branch** from `main` (see [naming convention](#5-branch-naming-convention))
3. **Make focused commits** (see [commit convention](#6-commit-message-convention))
4. **Run tests and lint** before pushing (see [section 7](#7-running-tests-and-lint))
5. **Open a pull request** against `main` on the upstream repo

## 5. Branch Naming Convention

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

| Prefix      | When to use                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `feature/`  | New functionality                          |
| `fix/`      | Bug fixes                                  |
| `docs/`     | Documentation only                         |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `test/`     | Adding or fixing tests                     |
| `chore/`    | Dependency bumps, config changes, CI       |
| `perf/`     | Performance improvements                   |

**Examples:**

```
feature/p2p-loan-request-api
fix/balance-panel-undefined-key
docs/add-soroban-integration-guide
refactor/extract-stellar-client-singleton
test/increase-community-routes-coverage
chore/upgrade-stellar-sdk-v13
```

- Use lowercase and hyphens, no underscores or slashes in the description
- Keep it under 50 characters
- Reference the issue number when applicable: `fix/42-trustline-limit-zero`

---

## 6. Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

[optional body]

[optional footer: BREAKING CHANGE / Closes #issue]
```

### Types

| Type       | When to use                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | A new feature                              |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                  |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes only                 |
| `style`    | Formatting, whitespace — no logic change   |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring with no behavior change |
| `test`     | Adding or correcting tests                 |
| `chore`    | Build system, CI, dependency updates       |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                    |
| `revert`   | Reverting a previous commit                |

### Scopes

Use the module name: `contracts`, `api`, `db`, `frontend`, `docker`, `docs`.

### Examples

```
feat(contracts): add batch payment operation for multi-recipient disbursal

fix(api): return 409 instead of 500 when community name already exists

docs(contributing): add conflict resolution section

test(contracts): add hasTrustline unit tests for native-only accounts

chore(docker): upgrade postgres image from 15 to 16-alpine

feat(frontend): add BalancePanel component with 15s SWR refresh

BREAKING CHANGE: establishTrustline now requires assetIssuer instead of Asset object
```

### Rules

- Subject line: imperative mood, lowercase, no period, ≤72 characters
- Body: wrap at 80 characters, explain _why_ not _what_
- One logical change per commit; squash WIP commits before opening a PR

---

## 7. Running Tests and Lint

**Always run these before pushing.**

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run type-check    # TypeScript (no emit)
npm test              # Jest unit + integration
npm run test:coverage # Coverage report

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run lint          # Next.js ESLint
npm run type-check    # TypeScript
npm test              # Jest + Testing Library
```

### Coverage thresholds

- Backend: minimum **70%** line coverage (enforced in CI)
- Frontend: minimum **60%** component coverage

### Pre-push hook (optional but recommended)

```bash
# Install lefthook
npm install -g lefthook
lefthook install
```

This runs lint + type-check automatically before each push.

## 8. Pull Request Process

### Before Opening

- [ ] Branch is up to date with `upstream/main` (rebase, not merge)
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Lint and type-check pass
- [ ] New features have accompanying tests
- [ ] Documentation updated if public API changed

### PR Template

When you open a PR, fill in the auto-generated template:

```markdown
## What does this PR do?

<!-- 2-3 sentences. Link to the issue it closes. -->

Closes #<issue_number>

## Type of change

- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Tests only

## Testing

<!-- How did you test this? What scenarios did you cover? -->

## Screenshots (if frontend)

<!-- Before/after or just "after" for new UI -->

## Checklist

- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Docs updated
- [ ] No secrets in diff
- [ ] Rebased on upstream/main
```

### Review SLA

- Maintainers aim to review within **72 hours** of opening
- If no response in 5 business days, ping `@maintainers` in the PR comment

### Merge Strategy

- **Squash and merge** is the default — keeps `main` history linear
- Multi-commit PRs that tell a meaningful story may be **merge committed** at maintainer discretion
- **No force-pushes to `main`** ever

---

## 9. Code Review Checklist

Reviewers use this checklist when approving PRs:

### Correctness

- [ ] Logic is correct for both happy path and error cases
- [ ] No unhandled promise rejections
- [ ] Stellar operations handle network failures gracefully

### Security

- [ ] No private keys logged or returned in API responses
- [ ] User input validated at API boundary (`express-validator`)
- [ ] No SQL injection vectors (parameterized queries only)
- [ ] No new CORS or CSP weakening

### Code Quality

- [ ] TypeScript `strict` mode — no `any` without justification
- [ ] Functions are small, named clearly, and do one thing
- [ ] No commented-out code or debug `console.log`
- [ ] Comments explain _why_, not _what_

### Testing

- [ ] New feature has at least one unit test
- [ ] Edge cases and error paths are tested
- [ ] Mocks are scoped and cleaned up in `afterEach`

### Documentation

- [ ] Public APIs are described in README.md if new
- [ ] PRD.md updated if feature changes scope or roadmap

## 10. Conflict Resolution Workflow

### For Code Conflicts (rebase approach)

```bash
# 1. Fetch latest upstream
git fetch upstream

# 2. Rebase your branch
git rebase upstream/main

# 3. Resolve conflicts in each file
#    - Accept upstream, yours, or combine manually
#    - Never blindly accept all of one side

# 4. Stage resolved files
git add <resolved-file>

# 5. Continue rebase
git rebase --continue

# 6. Force-push your branch (your fork only, never upstream main)
git push --force-with-lease origin <your-branch>
```

### For Design / Opinion Conflicts

1. **Label the PR** with `needs-discussion`
2. **State your position once**, clearly, with reasoning — not repeatedly
3. **Escalate to async discussion** in GitHub Discussions if unresolved after 3 comments
4. **Maintainer decision is final** after 5 business days of open discussion

### For Merge Conflicts in Long-Running PRs

If your PR has been open for more than 2 weeks and conflicts accumulate:

1. Close the PR
2. Rebase onto current `main`
3. Open a fresh PR with a note linking to the old one

This keeps the review diff clean and reviewable.

| `security`         | `#e11d48` | Security-sensitive — maintainer triage only |

### Reporting a Security Vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue.** Email `security@cooplumen.org` with:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact

We will acknowledge within 24 hours and disclose responsibly after a fix is deployed.

---

## 12. Maintainer Responsibilities

[BigNathan1](https://github.com/BigNathan1) is the sole maintainer of this repository, with the only
write access to `main`. Responsibilities:

- **Triage new issues** within 72 hours (add labels, request clarification, or close as duplicate)
- **Review PRs** within 72 hours of opening or update
- **Enforce** the branch model and commit convention on all merges
- **Maintain** the `main` branch in a deployable state at all times
- **Keep** the roadmap in PRD.md current each quarter
- **Release** tagged versions (`v0.x.y`) monthly during active development phases

Contributors are recognized on the [Contributors leaderboard](CONTRIBUTORS.md) rather than through
maintainer nomination — there is no path to write access via contribution volume.
