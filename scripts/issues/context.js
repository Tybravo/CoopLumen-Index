 */
const PHASE_CONTEXT = {
  'PHASE 1 — FOUNDATION':
    'Foundation work to reach a working single-community MVP: infrastructure, schema, core CRUD APIs, the Stellar contract layer, the base frontend, wallet auth, tests, CI, and a hardened security baseline. Every later phase assumes this phase is solid.',
  'PHASE 2 — P2P LENDING & MULTI-SIG':
    'The first major post-MVP capability: peer-to-peer lending pools with reputation scoring, plus multi-signature treasury controls and batch payouts, so a community can coordinate real money beyond simple token transfers.',
  'PHASE 3 — SOROBAN GOVERNANCE':
    'On-chain governance via a Soroban smart contract — token-weighted proposals and voting — so binding community decisions no longer depend on the backend as a trusted intermediary.',
  'PHASE 4 — COMPLIANCE, ADVANCED FEATURES & PRODUCTION':
    'The path to a public, mainnet launch: KYC/compliance groundwork, price/localization/mobile polish, performance hardening, documentation, and the final production go-live checklist.',
};

const CATEGORY_CONTEXT = {
  'Infrastructure & Environment':
    'Baseline developer experience and repo hygiene — Docker Compose services, environment validation, formatting/linting/commit hooks, and the GitHub community files (CODEOWNERS, issue/PR templates, SECURITY.md) that make the project approachable to a first-time contributor.',
  'Database Schema & Migrations':
    'The file-based migration runner (`backend/src/db/migrate.ts`) and the PostgreSQL schema it applies — communities, members, tokens, and the tables reserved for later phases (loans, reputation, multisig, proposals, KYC) that stay dormant until their phase activates them. Schema correctness here underpins every API built on top of it.',
  'Backend API — Communities':
    "The communities router (`backend/src/api/routes/communities.ts`) — CRUD, membership, and treasury endpoints for the platform's core unit. Every other feature (tokens, loans, governance) is scoped to a community.",
  'Backend API — Tokens':
    "The tokens router and the `contracts/assets.ts` wrappers it calls — issuing, transferring, and querying each community's Stellar custom asset. Off-chain metadata (Postgres) and on-chain state (Horizon) have to stay consistent here.",
  'Backend API — Balances & Transactions':
    "Endpoints that read and write Stellar account state — balances, trustlines, payments, and the transaction-history audit trail. Handling Horizon's async, eventually-consistent behavior correctly (retries, sequence numbers, mapped error codes) matters more here than almost anywhere else in the backend.",
  'Stellar Contract Layer':
    'The `backend/src/contracts/` Stellar SDK wrapper layer (`stellar.ts`, `assets.ts`, `trustlines.ts`, `transactions.ts`) that every route handler calls into. This is the one place Horizon interaction logic should live — route handlers stay thin and testable.',
  'Frontend — Core & Design System':
    'The shared UI building blocks (`frontend/src/components/ui/`, the `globals.css` design tokens, dark mode, form primitives) that every feature screen is built from. Getting this right once makes every later screen faster to build and visually consistent.',
  'Frontend — Feature Components & Pages':
    'The actual Next.js App Router pages and feature components that let a member use the product end-to-end: dashboard, community detail, membership, tokens, transactions, treasury.',
  'Frontend — Hooks & Data Layer':
    'The SWR-based data-fetching hooks (`frontend/src/hooks/`) that mediate between the UI and the backend API — caching, mutation, optimistic updates, and Freighter signing. Keeping fetch/mutate logic out of components is what keeps the feature layer testable.',
  'Authentication & Authorization':
    "A wallet-based auth flow (challenge → Freighter signature → JWT) and the RBAC middleware that guards write endpoints. Until this lands, every write endpoint is trusting the caller's claimed identity.",
  'Testing — Backend':
    'Integration and unit coverage for the API layer, run against a real (containerized) PostgreSQL instance wherever the behavior under test is about persistence, not mocks standing in for it.',
  'Testing — Frontend & E2E':
    "Component-level tests plus a Playwright E2E suite exercising real user flows against the full Docker Compose stack — the project's highest-confidence signal that a change didn't break the product.",
  'CI/CD Pipeline':
    'The GitHub Actions workflows that gate every PR (lint, typecheck, test, build) and automate release/deploy once merged. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the current source of truth for what is already enforced — check it before assuming a check is missing.',
  'Security Hardening':
    'Defense-in-depth beyond auth: rate limiting, input sanitization, security headers, audit logging, and the external review/disclosure process needed before real funds are at stake.',
  'P2P Lending':
    'The Phase 2 headline feature: members request, fund, and repay peer-to-peer loans, with reputation scores computed from repayment history. Activates the `loans`, `loan_repayments`, and `reputation_scores` tables that Phase 1 left dormant.',
  'Multi-Sig & Batch Operations':
    'N-of-M signer controls on community treasury accounts, plus batch disbursement tooling — the primitives a community needs to manage shared funds safely once it outgrows a single trusted administrator.',
  'Soroban Smart Contracts & Governance':
    'A Rust/Soroban smart contract for token-weighted, on-chain proposals and voting, plus the backend/frontend layers that surface it. This is where community decision-making moves from "the backend says so" to "the chain says so."',
  'KYC & Compliance':
    'Groundwork for operating within real-world regulatory constraints — SEP-12-aligned KYC status tracking, per-account transaction limits, and Sybil resistance — scoped deliberately narrow (research and status plumbing) rather than a full compliance platform.',
  'Price Oracle, Mobile & i18n':
    'Product polish that matters for real-world adoption across languages and devices: live price display, a PWA-installable frontend, and translated UI for non-English-speaking communities.',
  'Performance & Optimization':
    'Caching, indexing, and load-testing work to make sure the platform holds up once real communities are using it concurrently — backed by measured before/after numbers, not guesses.',
  Documentation:
    "Reference material a new contributor or self-hosting operator needs that isn't already covered by a category-specific doc: the OpenAPI spec, the deployment guide, and the onboarding walkthrough.",
  'Production Readiness':
    'The final go/no-go checklist before real money moves on Stellar mainnet: observability, an external security audit, and the mainnet cutover itself.',
};
